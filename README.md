# Cats, Bats, and Spiders Hacktoberfest Starter Project

This project is open to anyone on Github, especially those of us who are new to the open source community! Here you can practice contributing to an open source project, and get more comfortable contributing to others here on Github. 

I thought it would be fun to create a simple FizzBuzz challenge project but in the spirit of Halloween, use cats, bats, and spiders!

### Rules 
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for numbers that are multiples of 3, print 'cats' instead of the number, for numbers that are multiples of 5 print 'bats' instead of the number, and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 print 'spiders'.
